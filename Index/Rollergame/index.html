                    <p>Roller Game <small>or just Roller</small> is a game I made with libGDX and Java library "motej"</p>
                    <p>The goal of the game is to move the Wii Remote according to where you want to tilt the "table", and the wooden ball will move. You then collect the coins on the stage<sup>[1]</sup> and make your way to the finishing hole.</p>

                    <p>I will not be able to explain all the code, but I will try my best to explain how to do it.</p>
                    <p>First, I've created a game, and made a MoteHelper class to ease the input processing. Then I've made it so the helper starts scanning and assigning itself a remote when the application is open<sup>[2]</sup>. After that, the game sets the screen to the title screen where you can see if you have connected a controller or not. I've added the options "Play", "Settings" and "Exit". The setting button sets the screen to the settings screen, the exit button calls an exit function, and the play button sets the screen to the level select screen.</p>
                    <p>Then, the game reads the sharedpreferences to see what is the highest cleared level. The game locks the locked levels, and unlocks the previously finished levels accordingly.</p>
                    <p>When a level is selected, the game loads a shared JSON file, and reads the index of the level. It gets the collision data, coin locations, finish location, the maximum time and maximum collisions and writes it to a variable in the LevelLoader class.</p>
                    <p>After that, Box2D was used to create bodies for the ball, and the collision rectangles. The coin and finish detections are not etablished with Box2D</p>
                    <p>Every frame, the body for the ball has force applied by values the accelerometer is outputing through the remote.</p>
                    <p>While the game is running, it checks for:</p>
                    <li>If the ESCAPE key is pressed, or the plus button on the Wii Remote is pressed</li>
                    <li>If the time has ran out</li> 
                    <li>If the collision count has reached the maximum</li>
                    <li>If a coin is touched</li>
                    <li>If the ball has entered the finish circle</li>
                    <p>The game stops rendering and overlays a pause menu or a fail menu accordingly.</p>
                    <p>After a level is finished, the game increments the sharedpreference by one, so the next level is unlocked</p>
                    <p>There are 4 levels in the game as of now, which the first 3 has increasing difficulties as the level number goes up, and the fourth level is a special level which is made to be easier, but there is a flashlight-like mode where the whole screen is covered with black, except the area around the ball.</p>
